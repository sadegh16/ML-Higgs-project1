# ML-Higgs-project1



## GMachine Learning Course
Fall 2021

The repository contains the code for Machine Learning course 2021 (CS-433) project 1 (Higgs Boson challenge: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs/leaderboards) at EPFL. More information about this challenge can be found in the folder `documents`.

### Team members

- Mohammadsadegh Khorasani
- Fatemeh Jamshidi
- Ehsan Mokhtarian



### Required libraries
 `numpy`, `matplotlib`and `csv`

### Results
final predictions on test data `predict.csv`.
* * *


### Main codes
`implementations.py`: the implementation of 6 methods to train the model.

`run.py`: an script to run the best model and generate submission file

### Hyperparameter tuning:

using cross-validation to test the accuracy of different models.


### Notebook

`ml_epfl.ipynb`: all the running and testing used by this file, so you can check the output of cells to see the results

### Documentation

`report.pdf`: a 2-pages report of the complete solution.
